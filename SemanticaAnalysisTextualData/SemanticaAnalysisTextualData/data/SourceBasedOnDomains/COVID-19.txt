COVID-19 is a contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread to become a global pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and a pandemic in March 2020.

The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, and loss of taste or smell. In severe cases, COVID-19 can lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Older adults and individuals with underlying health conditions are at higher risk of severe illness.

To combat the pandemic, governments and health organizations implemented measures like lockdowns, social distancing, and mask mandates. Vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed, with the first vaccines receiving emergency use authorization in December 2020. Major vaccines include Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca. Vaccination campaigns have been rolled out worldwide, significantly reducing the spread of the virus and the severity of illness.

Despite these efforts, the pandemic has had a profound impact on global health, economies, and societies. It has highlighted the importance of preparedness for future pandemics and the need for international cooperation in addressing global health challenges.

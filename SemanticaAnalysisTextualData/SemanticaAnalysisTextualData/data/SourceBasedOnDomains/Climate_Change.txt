Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities release large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the Earth's temperature to rise.

The effects of climate change are widespread and devastating. Rising global temperatures lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires. Melting polar ice caps and glaciers contribute to rising sea levels, threatening coastal communities and ecosystems. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and storms, are becoming more intense and unpredictable. Climate change also disrupts ecosystems, leading to the loss of biodiversity and the extinction of species.

To combat climate change, governments, organizations, and individuals must take urgent action. Solutions include transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower; reducing carbon emissions through energy efficiency and sustainable transportation; and protecting and restoring forests and other natural carbon sinks. International agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to limit global warming to well below 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels.

Climate change is not just an environmental issue but also a social and economic one. It disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including low-income communities and developing countries. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation, innovation, and a commitment to sustainable development.

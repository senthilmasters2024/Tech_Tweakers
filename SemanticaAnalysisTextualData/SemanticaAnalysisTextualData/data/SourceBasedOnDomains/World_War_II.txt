World War II (1939â€“1945) was a global conflict that involved most of the world's nations, including the major powers of the Allies (United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union) and the Axis (Germany, Japan, Italy). It was the deadliest conflict in human history, resulting in over 70 million deaths, including civilians and military personnel.

The war began with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, prompting Britain and France to declare war. Over the next six years, the conflict spread across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Key events include the Battle of Stalingrad, the D-Day invasion of Normandy, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The Holocaust, the systematic genocide of six million Jews by Nazi Germany, remains one of the most horrific atrocities of the war. The war also saw the use of new technologies, such as radar, jet engines, and nuclear weapons, which had a profound impact on the course of the conflict and the post-war world.

World War II reshaped the global political landscape, leading to the establishment of the United Nations and the beginning of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. It also marked the end of European colonialism and the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers.

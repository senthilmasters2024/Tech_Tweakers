Paracetamol (Acetaminophen): A Comprehensive Overview

Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a widely used medication for treating fever and mild to moderate pain. It is one of the most commonly used over-the-counter (OTC) drugs worldwide due to its effectiveness and relatively low risk of side effects when used as directed. Paracetamol is often preferred for individuals who cannot take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or aspirin due to allergies or gastrointestinal issues.

   - It is commonly used for pain management in conditions like arthritis and post-surgical recovery.

2. Fever Reduction (Antipyretic):
   - Paracetamol is widely used to reduce fever in adults and children. It is a preferred choice for pediatric fever management due to its safety profile.

3. Cold and Flu Symptoms:

Side Effects and Risks

When used as directed, paracetamol is generally safe and well-tolerated. However, excessive use or overdose can lead to serious side effects, including:

1. Liver Damage:
   - Overdose of paracetamol is a leading cause of acute liver failure. The toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) accumulates in the liver and causes damage.
   - Symptoms of overdose include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice.

2. Allergic Reactions:
   - Rarely, some individuals may experience allergic reactions, such as rash, itching, or swelling.

3. Other Side Effects:
   - Long-term use of high doses may lead to kidney damage or blood disorders, although these are rare.

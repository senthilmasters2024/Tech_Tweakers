Published: February 8, 2025

Sachin Tendulkar, often hailed as the "Little Master," continues to be a monumental figure in the cricketing world. His illustrious career, spanning over two decades, has left an indelible mark on the sport.

Born on April 24, 1973, in Mumbai, India, Tendulkar made his international debut at the tender age of 16 against Pakistan in 1989. Over the years, he amassed numerous records, cementing his place as one of the greatest batsmen in cricket history. He holds the record for the most runs in both Test and One Day International (ODI) formats, with 15,921 runs in Tests and 18,426 in ODIs. Notably, he is the only cricketer to have scored 100 international centuriesâ€”a feat yet to be surpassed.

Semantic Similarity Analysis of Textual Data

Based on the researches, the following steps has been concluded:

1) Convert the word or text document at the input into tokens of numerical representation using OpenAI APIs
2) Using any of the similarity analysis methods before creating the embeddings such that similar or closely related vectors in the  vector space can be clustered.
Cosine Similarity
Euclidean Similarity
Jaccord Similarity
Pearson/Sparman Correlation
3)Now convert this token into Embeddings using GPIs tools in the high dimentional vector space
4) Now make use of various tools for visualization.

It is also founded that GPT doesnot provide numerical representation like models including Sentence-BERT. Also , the Embeddings can be word or Sentence Embedding depending on the context. OpenAI also provides  endpoint (/v1/embeddings) for obtaining embeddings directly, this is quite efficient than GPTs completion endpoint.

Also, OpenAI's provides the following text similarity models:

 .     text-similarity-ada-001
•	text-similarity-curie-001
•	text-similarity-davinci-002
•	text-similarity-babbage-002

Here, curie-001 and davinci-002 are expensive compared to others.

Semantic Similarity Analysis of Textual Data
This project performs semantic analysis of textual data using .NET and C# in Visual Studio. The system processes text inputs at three levels: word, phrase, and document. Inputs are stored in designated folders and fetched for processing. The analysis is based on cosine similarity to measure text similarity.

a) Technology Stack

Programming Language: C#

Development Environment: Visual Studio

Framework: .NET Core/.NET Framework

Libraries:

System.IO for file handling

ML.NET or custom implementations for cosine similarity

Other NLP libraries if required

b)Processing Steps are as follows:

Data Fetching: The program scans the designated folder and reads text files.

Preprocessing:

Tokenization

Stopword removal (if necessary)

Normalization

Feature Extraction:

Vectorization of text using TF-IDF

Cosine Similarity Computation:

Converts text into vector space

Computes similarity scores between input texts

Output Generation:

Stores results in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV, or database)

c) Cosine Similarity Calculation is performed on the following basis:

Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between text vectors:

d(A, B) = (A • B) / (||A|| ||B||)

Where:

A and B are text vectors

A • B represents the dot product of the vectors

||A|| and ||B|| are the magnitudes of the vectors

Based on the researches, the following steps has been decided to follow to implement the task succesfully:

1) Apply the input (word, text or documents) into a preprocessing section. 
2) The output from the preprocessor is successfully applied to a section to create Embeddings using OpenAi's GPT model. 
3) From the high dimensional vector space, using a similarity model, the 'Semantic Similarity' will be extracted.
4) For Visualization part, we need to generate CSV file and then can generate Heatmaps or Network Graphs for understanding.

It is also founded that GPT doesnot provide numerical representation directly unlike other models including Sentence-BERT. Also , the Embeddings can be word or Sentence Embedding depending on the context. OpenAI also provides  endpoint (/v1/embeddings) for obtaining embeddings directly, this is quite efficient than GPTs completion endpoint.

The following are some of the easily available OpenAI's models used by GPT to generate vector space:

 .     text-similarity-ada-001
•	text-similarity-babbage-002
•	text-similarity-curie-001
•	text-similarity-davinci-002


Here, the  text-similarity-ada-001 is the popular one among others due to its simplicity and speed. The text-similarity-babbage-002 model is expensive than "ada models" . Its is preferred over "ada" for those tasks demanding a reasonable balance with less computationally such as keyword matching, basic semantic similarity analysis. The text-similarity-curie-001model is the one with better accuracy and performance as well as costly compared to ada. The model text-similarity-davinci-002 is the most advanced and hence the expensive. It can be integrated with, for applications which needs the highest precision with the ability to understand complex contextual relationships.  
 
As mentioned once the vector space is obtained by Embeddings, we can extract the similarity by using the below metric models: 
Cosine similarity is the measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors widely applied in many machine learning and data analysis applications. It actually measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. As a result, an idea is given about how far the two vectors point in the same direction irrespective of their magnitudes. It can be found in popular usage in tasks of text analysis, such as comparison of similarity between documents, search queries, and even recommendation systems so that user preferences can be matched.

Similarity measure refers to distance with dimensions representing features of the data object, in a dataset. If this distance is less, there will be a high degree of similarity, but when the distance is large, there will be a low degree of similarity. Some of the popular similarity measures are given below:

Euclidean Distance
Manhattan Distance
Jaccard Similarity
Minkowski Distance
Cosine Similarity
What is Cosine Similarity?
Cosine similarity is a metric, helpful in determining, how similar the data objects are irrespective of their size. We can measure the similarity between two sentences in Python using Cosine Similarity. In cosine similarity, data objects in a dataset are treated as a vector. The formula to find the cosine similarity between two vectors is –

C

​
 (x, y) = x . y / ||x|| 
×
× ||y||
where,

x . y = product (dot) of the vectors ‘x’ and ‘y’.
||x|| and ||y|| = length (magnitude) of the two vectors ‘x’ and ‘y’.
||x|| 
×
× ||y|| = regular product of the two vectors ‘x’ and ‘y’.
Example
Consider an example to find the similarity between two vectors – ‘x’ and ‘y’, using Cosine Similarity. The ‘x’ vector has values, x = { 3, 2, 0, 5 } The ‘y’ vector has values, y = { 1, 0, 0, 0 } The formula for calculating the cosine similarity is :

 (x, y) = x . y / ||x||

x . y = 3*1 + 2*0 + 0*0 + 5*0 = 3

||x|| = √ (3)^2 + (2)^2 + (0)^2 + (5)^2 = 6.16

||y|| = √ (1)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 = 1

∴

 (x, y) = 3 / (6.16 * 1) = 0.49 

 (x, y) = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51
The cosine similarity between two vectors is measured in ‘θ’.
If θ = 0°, the ‘x’ and ‘y’ vectors overlap, thus proving they are similar.
If θ = 90°, the ‘x’ and ‘y’ vectors are dissimilar.

Of these above mentioned similarity metric models, the Cosine and Euclidean methods are the widely followed and easily adapted one due to less computational complexity.

In GPT models, vector representation refers to the numerical encoding of text (such as words, phrases, or entire documents) as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors capture semantic relationships and contextual information, enabling tasks like similarity measurement, clustering, and classification. Embeddings are essential for enhancing performance since they are a potent strategy for machine learning applications such as natural language processing.Here’s a breakdown of key concepts related to vector representations in GPT:

Token Embeddings:GPT processes text by first breaking it into tokens (subwords or characters), each mapped to an embedding vector.Embeddings are learned during training and represent each token’s meaning in context.Typical embedding dimensions range from 512 to 4096 depending on the model size.

 Positional Embeddings: Since GPT models lack inherent sequence awareness, positional embeddings are added to token embeddings to encode word order.This helps maintain contextual relationships in sequential data.

Hidden Layer Representations: As tokens pass through multiple transformer layers, their vector representations are updated.Each layer encodes increasingly abstract semantic features, with deeper layers capturing more complex patterns.
These hidden states can be extracted for downstream tasks.

Sentence and Document-Level Representations: To represent entire sentences or documents, you can pool token embeddings (e.g., averaging or using the embedding of the [CLS] token in models like BERT).
In GPT, pooling the final layer’s embeddings or using specific tokens can generate document-level vectors.
OpenAI Embeddings API: OpenAI offers dedicated embedding models (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002) that produce vector representations optimized for tasks like similarity search and classification.
Cosine Similarity and Distance Metrics: Vector comparisons typically use cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between vectors. Values range from -1 (opposite) to 1 (identical), with 0 indicating no similarity. These embeddings are often used with cosine similarity to measure the distance between vectors.

The significance of embeddings are significant for the following reasons:

Semantic representation: Embeddings simplify comparing and analyzing input data by capturing semantic meaning. Many natural language processing activities can perform better, including text categorization and sentiment analysis.

Lower dimensionality: Many machine learning methods become less computationally complex and operate more efficiently with big inputs because embeddings produce a lower-dimensional space representing high-dimensional vectors.

Reusability: An embedding is a potent and practical data analysis approach since it may be applied to various models and applications once produced.

Robustness: Embeddings are robust and useful for many industry applications because they can be trained on big datasets and capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

Some real world applications of embeddings are as fgollows:
In real-world machine-learning applications, embedded systems are critical in boosting search engines, voice assistants, image recognition systems, and natural language processing, among other domains, by optimizing data representation and performance.

Computer Vision
ChatGPT embeddings are used in computer vision to bridge contexts and facilitate transfer learning for applications such as AI Art Machines and self-driving cars. Models can be trained with visuals created from video games instead of real-world images by converting them into embeddings. Multiple transformations, from text to image and vice versa, are possible with this method.

Semantic Search
By considering word context and meaning, BERT-based embeddings improve search results and help search engines understand subtle linguistic differences. To improve the relevance and accuracy of search results and user experience, a semantic search engine that uses BERT would be able to comprehend, for example, that a user was looking for directions on making pizza.

Recommender System
A recommender system uses content-based and collaborative filtering to anticipate user preferences and ratings for entities or items. While content-based filtering employs embeddings to create associations between people and items, collaborative filtering leverages user activities to teach suggestions. Comparable items can be recommended to similar consumers by multiplying user embeddings by item embeddings, which generates rating predictions.

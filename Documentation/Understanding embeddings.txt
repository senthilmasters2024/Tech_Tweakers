Based on initial research BERT and ChatGPT embeddings looks suitable for the task because of availability of contextual embeddings. But needs practical testing.
Both BERT and Word2vec are opensource and free but needs local compute and ChatGPT has a freemium subscription model

Embeddings in machine learning are numerical representations of data, typically in a lower-dimensional space, that capture the essence or meaningful relationships within the data. They are used to simplify complex data and make it easier for machine learning models to process and analyze. Here's a deeper look:

Use Case Comparison with Examples
Semantic Search:

Word2Vec: Finds related terms in vector space.
BERT: Contextually retrieves relevant text.
ChatGPT Embeddings: Highly accurate, user-query-focused.

Question Answering:

Word2Vec: Limited contextual understanding.
BERT: State-of-the-art performance on QA tasks.
ChatGPT Embeddings: Excels in conversational or knowledge-intensive QA.

Recommendation Systems:

Word2Vec: Similar word or item retrieval.
BERT: Semantic similarity between sentences/items.
ChatGPT Embeddings: Personalized recommendations based on complex inputs.

Document Clustering:

Word2Vec: Basic clustering based on word similarity.
BERT: Clusters based on sentence meaning.
ChatGPT Embeddings: Clusters capturing nuanced semantic relationships.

Code Embedding:

Word2Vec: Rarely used.
BERT: Some support for embeddings of code text.
ChatGPT Embeddings: Capable of processing and embedding code snippets.

Word2Vec
Availability: Completely free and open-source.
How to Use:
Pre-trained Word2Vec models are available (e.g., trained on Google News or Wikipedia) and can be downloaded.
Libraries like Gensim (Python) or TensorFlow support Word2Vec.
Where to Find:
Pre-trained Word2Vec models from Google: Google Code Archive - Word2Vec.
Python library: Gensim.
Infrastructure Requirements:
Low resource requirements compared to BERT.
Runs efficiently on CPUs.
Limitations:
Static embeddings (word meanings don’t change based on context).
BERT
Availability: Free and open-source, released by Google Research.
How to Use:
Pre-trained BERT models are available on platforms like Hugging Face and TensorFlow Hub.
Hugging Face provides an easy interface to download and use models with libraries like transformers.
Fine-tuning BERT for specific tasks (like classification) is also possible.
Where to Find:
Hugging Face: Hugging Face Models.
TensorFlow Hub: BERT Models on TensorFlow Hub.
PyTorch: Integration with the transformers library.
Infrastructure Requirements:
High resource requirements (GPU recommended for efficient training and inference).
Models are computationally intensive compared to Word2Vec.
Limitations:
Larger memory and compute requirements compared to lightweight models like Word2Vec.
Key Points:
Both BERT and Word2Vec can be used free of charge but differ in computational demands and capabilities.
Word2Vec is lightweight and straightforward to implement but lacks contextual understanding.
BERT provides powerful contextual embeddings but requires more computational resources.

Word2Vec
Word2Vec is a shallow neural network-based model developed by Google in 2013 to create dense, distributed word embeddings. It learns vector representations of words from large corpora, capturing semantic relationships and similarities.

How Word2Vec Works:
Word2Vec has two main architectures:

Skip-Gram:

Predicts the context words given a target word.
Example: If the target word is "cat," the model predicts nearby words like "furry" or "pet."
Focus: Captures rare word relationships well.
Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW):

Predicts the target word given its context words.
Example: Given the context words "furry" and "pet," the model predicts "cat."
Focus: Faster training compared to Skip-Gram.
Features and Characteristics:
Produces fixed-size vector representations of words (e.g., 100, 300 dimensions).
Captures semantic relationships:
Example: vector("king") - vector("man") + vector("woman") ≈ vector("queen")
Vectors are dense and optimized for computational efficiency.
Applications:
Semantic similarity and clustering.
Input for downstream NLP tasks like sentiment analysis.
Basis for recommendation systems or information retrieval.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
BERT is a deep neural network model introduced by Google in 2018. It is based on the Transformer architecture and is designed to create context-aware embeddings for words and sentences.

Key Innovations in BERT:
Bidirectional Context:

Unlike Word2Vec, which uses a unidirectional or limited context, BERT processes words in both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left) to capture richer relationships.
Example: In the sentence "He painted a picture of a bank," BERT understands whether "bank" means "riverbank" or "financial institution" based on context.
Pretraining Objectives:

Masked Language Modeling (MLM):
Randomly masks words in a sentence and trains the model to predict them.
Example: "He painted a picture of a [MASK]." → Predicts "bank."
Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):
Determines if one sentence logically follows another.
Example: Sentence 1: "He went to the riverbank." Sentence 2: "The water was calm." → True.
Features and Characteristics:
Contextual embeddings:
The same word can have different embeddings depending on its usage.
Example: "bank" in "riverbank" vs. "financial bank" has different embeddings.
Highly versatile for sentence-level tasks.
Applications:
Text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis).
Named entity recognition (NER).
Question answering (e.g., SQuAD).
Text summarization and paraphrasing.
Semantic search and embedding generation.

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain, inflammation, and fever. It is commonly prescribed for conditions such as arthritis, menstrual cramps, muscle pain, and minor injuries. Ibuprofen works by blocking the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation and pain.

Aspirin is a salicylate drug commonly used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation. It is also used as a blood thinner to prevent heart attacks and strokes in individuals at risk. Aspirin functions by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which plays a key role in inflammation and clot formation.

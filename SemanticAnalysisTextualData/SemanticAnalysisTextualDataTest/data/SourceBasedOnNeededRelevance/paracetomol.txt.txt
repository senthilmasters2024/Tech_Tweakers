Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a medication used to treat fever and mild to moderate pain. It is commonly used to relieve headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. Paracetamol works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins in the brain, which helps reduce pain and fever.
